# Parametric Design x Data Viz

Hi I'm Sophie and I created this website during the Parametric Design course taught by Prof. Sebastian Meier at the <a href="https://www.fh-potsdam.de/" target="_blank">University of Applied Sciences Potsdam</a> in the winter semester of 2023/24.

In this course, we explored the fundamentals of parametric design, shaping through computer code. How can we possibly develop our own tools? Inspired by Hawkins' climate stripes, I wrote my own JavaScript code, which also led to the creation of this website.

**It's not a bug, it's a feature.**

I'm an interface design student and not a scientist - so if there are any factual errors, please feel free to report them to me. Also, I'm not a programmer, so forgive me if you find one or two bugs.
I'm looking forward to your feedback!
