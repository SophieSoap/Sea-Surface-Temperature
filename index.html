      <h1>Too hot to be cool</h1>
      <p>Over 70% of Earth's surface is ocean, which plays a major role in regulating the global climate system. The Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is the temperature of the top millimeter of the ocean's surface, which impact weather patterns, as well as plant and animal life in the ocean. Additionally, oceans absorb a significant portion of heat trapped by increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas levels, causing ocean temperatures to rise. In this study the SST anomalies are calculated as temperature differences from the 1961-1990 period.</p>

      <p>The year 2023 has been confirmed as the warmest on record, driven by human-caused climate change and boosted by the natural El Niño weather event. During the past four decades, SST have exceeded the 20th century average every year and are now higher than at any other time since records began. Warmer oceans lead to more water vapour in the atmosphere, which feeds weather events such as rainfall, snowfall, and cyclones. Major shifts in SSTs also affect the survival and migration patterns of marine life, which ultimately impacting human live too. SST data is essential for understanding the response of the ocean to global warming and, in turn, how that response may influence other changes in climate.</p>
